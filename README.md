Part 1:
Java Program: Menu-Driven Factorial and Fibonacci Calculator

Description:
This Java program implements a menu-driven console application for calculating factorial and generating Fibonacci series based on user input. The program utilizes BufferedReader and InputStreamReader to read input from the console and provides a user-friendly menu interface for interacting with the functionalities.

Features:
Calculate Factorial: Allows users to input a positive integer and calculates its factorial recursively.
Generate Fibonacci Series: Prompts users to enter the number of terms and generates the Fibonacci series accordingly.
Menu Interface: Provides a clear menu interface for users to select the desired operation.
Input Validation: Validates user input to ensure it meets the required criteria.
Looping Menu: Continuously displays the menu until the user chooses to exit.
Usage:
Compile the Java program using javac part1.java.
Run the compiled program using java part1.
Follow the on-screen prompts to select an operation and provide input as requested.

Part 2:
Java Program: Calculator

Description:
This Java program consists of two classes: functions and calculator_main.

functions Class:
The functions class contains various mathematical functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root, power, mean, and variance. These functions are implemented to perform basic arithmetic operations and statistical calculations.

add(double a, double b): Returns the sum of two double values.
subtract(double a, double b): Returns the difference between two double values.
multiply(double a, double b): Returns the product of two double values.
divide(double a, double b): Returns the result of dividing two double values. Throws an IllegalArgumentException if the second parameter is zero.
sqrt(double a): Returns the square root of a double value.
power(double a, double b): Returns the result of raising a double value to the power of another double value.
mean(double[] numbers): Returns the mean (average) of an array of double values.
variance(double[] numbers): Returns the variance of an array of double values.
calculator_main Class:
The calculator_main class serves as the entry point for the program. It creates an instance of the functions class and provides a menu-driven interface for users to perform various mathematical operations.

The main method displays a menu with options to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root, power, mean, variance, and exit the program.
Users can input numbers and select operations based on the menu options.
The program performs the selected operation using the functions class and displays the result.
Usage:
Compile the Java program using javac calculator_main.java functions.java.
Run the compiled program using java calculator_main.
Follow the on-screen prompts to select an operation and provide input as requested.
